# Algorithm and Data Structure Analysis  

This repository contains my **Algorithm and Data Structure Analysis** assignments, all implemented in **C++**. Each assignment focuses on fundamental data structures and algorithms, including arithmetic operations, trees, hash tables, and graph algorithms.  

## Assignment 1: Introduction to C++ and Karatsuba Multiplication  
This assignment introduced me to **C++** and involved implementing various arithmetic operations:  

- **Addition and Subtraction** algorithms  
- **Karatsuba Multiplication** â€“ a divide-and-conquer algorithm for fast multiplication  
- **Division** (required for postgraduate students)  

## Assignment 2: AVL Tree Implementation  
Implemented an **AVL tree**, a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring:  

- Automatic **rebalancing** after insertions and deletions  
- Optimized **time complexity** of O(log n) for insertions, deletions, and searches  

## Assignment 3: Hash Table with Linear Probing  
Developed a **hash table** data structure using:  

- **Linear probing** for collision resolution  
- Efficient **insertion, deletion, and search** operations  

## Assignment 4: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)  
Implemented a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithm of my choice. I chose **Kruskal's Algorithm**, which:  

- Uses **Greedy approach** to find the MST  
- Sorts edges and applies the **Union-Find** data structure for cycle detection  
- Runs in **O(E log E)** time complexity
